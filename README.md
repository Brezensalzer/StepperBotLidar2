# StepperBotLidar2

Rotating 360 degree Lidar based on the TF Mini sensor. This is part of a larger robot project. 
Arduino Code is for a Bluepill board but should be easily adaptable to other boards. 
Openscad, FreeCAD drawings and STL files are provided for 3D printing.

To complete the mechanical build, the following parts are needed:
- TF Mini Lidar
- Stepper motor 8HS11-0204S (bought from stepperonline)
- Ball bearing SS6000ZZ 26x10x8 V2A
- ca. 2cm of 10mm aluminium pipe
- Slip ring with 22m flange, 6 wires
